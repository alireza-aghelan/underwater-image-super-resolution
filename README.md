# underwater-image-super-resolution

In this work, we modify the Real-Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (Real-ESRGAN) model to enhance the resolution and quality of underwater images. In our proposed approach, the pre-trained generator and discriminator networks of the Real-ESRGAN model are fine-tuned using underwater image datasets. 

We used USR-248 and UFO-120 datasets to fine-tune the Real-ESRGAN model. Our fine-tuned model produces images with better resolution and quality compared to the original model.

Datasets can be downloaded from the link below:

The Real-ESRGAN code is borrowed from https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN.

Below are some outputs of the real-esrgan model and the fine-tuned model:
