# Underwater image super-resolution

In this project, we fine-tune the pre-trained Real-Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (Real-ESRGAN) model for underwater image super-resolution. We use USR-248 dataset for fine-tuning the model. The proposed model generates more realistic and higher-quality images compared to the original Real-ESRGAN model.

The Real-ESRGAN code is borrowed from https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN.

Results for different underwater images are shown in the following figures.

Columns 1â€“4 are input images, original Real-ESRGAN outputs, fine-tuned Real-ESRGAN outputs, and original images.
