# underwater-image-super-resolution

Underwater images are used in oceanic engineering and various applications such as underwater robot vision and underwater autonomous vehicles, etc. Single image super-resolution (SISR) methods can improve the resolution and quality of underwater images. 

Real-Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (Real-ESRGAN) is one of the recent practical models that have been used to generate higher-resolution images from lower-resolution input images. 
In this work, we use this model to increase the resolution and quality of underwater images. In our proposed approach, the pre-trained generator and discriminator networks of the real-esrgan model are fine-tuned using underwater image datasets.

We used the USR-248 dataset and UFO-120 dataset to fine-tune the real-esrgan model.
Our fine-tuned model produces images with better resolution and quality compared to the original real-esrgan model.

All details and fine-tuning parameters are available in the finetune_realesrgan_x4plus.yml file.

It is also possible to test the original real-esrgan model and fine-tuned model in the fine_tune_underwater.ipynb file

Below are some outputs of the real-esrgan model and the fine-tuned model:

1â€“4 columns are the LR degraded images, the outputs of the original real-esrgan, the outputs of the fine-tuned model after 8 epoch, and the outputs of the fine-tuned model after 20 epoch.
